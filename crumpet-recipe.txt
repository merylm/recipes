Crumpet recipe

What you need
2 cups of flour
4 tablespoons sugar
2 eggs
10ml melted butter
250ml milk
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 1teaspoons salt

The Process
Sift all the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.
Beat eggs, milk and melted butter in a separate bowl.
Mix the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients. Stir well to form a smooth batter.
The secret to crumpets is this…….. LEAVE THE MIXTURE TO STAND FOR 1/2 AN HOUR.
Cook crumpets in a greased pan on medium heat on the stove. Turn over when the bottom is golden and the bubbles are popping on the surface.
Sprinkle them with a little icing sugar and a knob of butter to fancy them up a bit. Drizzle over syrup, jam or whatever your sweet tooth longs for. (Nutella is great as well)
